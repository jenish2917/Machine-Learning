types of machine learning :
- supervised :
    -regression :
        - idea : predict the value of a continuous output variable based on one or more input features .

    -classification :
        - idea : predict the value of a categorical output variable based on one or more input features .


- unsupervised :
    -clustering :
        - idea : group similar data points into clusters based on their features .

    - dimensionality reduction :
        - idea : reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving the most important information .
    
    - Anomaly ditection
        - idea : identify data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data (outlires).

    - association :
        - idea : identify relationships between variables in a dataset .

    - recommendation
    - deep learning

- semisupervised :
    - idea : use a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to improve the accuracy of a model
    - example : google photos 

-  reinforcement learning :
    - idea : learn from trial and error by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for
